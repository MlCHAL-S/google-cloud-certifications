# Cloud Audit Logs - System Event Audit Logs

## Step-01: Introduction
- We are going to learn about **System Event Audit Logs**
### When will these logs get generated ?
- On host maintenance (compute.instances.migrateOnHostMaintenance)
- Instance preemption
- Automatic restart (compute.instances.automaticRestart)
- Instance reset
- Serial port connect/disconnect 2 (google.ssh-serialport.v1.connect)

## Step-02: Logging Explorer - Log Name: system_event (audit_log)
- **Sample Activities:** Google cloud generated system Events
- Verify logs for last 1 month to see what all System event logs generated by Google Cloud
```t
# Log Query
logName="projects/gcplearn9/logs/cloudaudit.googleapis.com%2Fsystem_event"
```

## Step-03: Additional Observation: Synthetic Monitor Logs
